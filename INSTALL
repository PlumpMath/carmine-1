How to install the Carmine script
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can place the exporter in the scripts folder situated in the ".blender" folder.

You may also place a link to the script at this location and edit it from a custom location. 
This would be useful if you are making changes to the script to suit your needs.



How to export a scene
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the "carmine" option from the Export scripts must show the exporter's UI.
It is fairly simple to use. Once the "Export" button is clicked, the scene is exported to a 
"gen" folder which is created at the path from which Blender3D is run. It is vital that you name
the scene and all the exported objects with distinct "C or C++ friendly" names.

For every scene exported, a corresponding .C and .H file is generated. These files must be 
included in development project for further use. To ease the development, "extern" references to 
each entity is listed as a comment at the end of the .H file. This way, you can copy the text to 
add objects to you application and start controlling it right away.



How to build and run the demo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently the demos are known to build and run on Linux. Official windows version will be available soon.
To build the demos you will need the following libraries installed on your system.

FTGL,
Freetype,
FreeImage,
SDL,
and OpenGL

After correcting any path for the above libraries in the Sconstruct file, you may build the project.

1- Run Blender3D with the current path as the topmost folder in the carmine project (where the 
   SConstruct script exists).
2- Open any one one of the blender scenes provided in the "models" folder. Export using 
   File->Export->carmine(.py).
3- Run "scons" from the topmost folder in the carmine project.
4- Copy any images used as textures from "models/Images" to "bin/Images". This step is not 
   required for the examples as duplicate image files already exist in "bin/Images" the folder.
5- Change working directory to the "bin" folder.
6- Run "./carmine" from the command prompt.
7- You may use TAB to switch through the cameras in the scene. The "l" key can be used to toggle 
   the lighting. The "w" key can be used to slide the object named "CentreAnchor".



How to build the source documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will require Doxygen to generate the source documentation. Please run "doxygen doxygen.conf" 
from command line with the current path as the topmost folder in the carmine project (where the 
SConstruct script exists).



Hope you find carmine useful.
