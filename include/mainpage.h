* \section intro_sec Overview
* 
* I enjoy working on 3D graphics, be it programming with OpenGL and its extensions or modelling nitty gritty details into a 
* scene with Blender3D. I am sure that any OpenGL programmer would find pride in developing a quick demo or trying out a new 
* add-on library. This works well if you are experienced or have the comfort of using several of the  publicly available 
* libraries for your platform. The most common libraries or frameworks are used with an intent to load models or create scene 
* graphs. However, not all programmers would like to use bulky model loaders and would prefer to use something light weight. 
* This is true especially on embedded systems (using OpenGL ES) where a programmer is constrained by system resources and 
* of course... limited number of options to load models. This becomes tougher for novice OpenGL programmers who need to render 
* a simple scene without having to hassle with large APIs.
* 
* I went through something similar when I was attempting my 3D project.  Since Blender3D has a fantastic plugin interface, I 
* wrote the "carmine" exporter to export simple scene setups in Blender 3D to readily usable code C / C++ structures and arrays. 
* The data was written to suit OpenGL requirements and optimized for space consumption. Additionally, I added the ability to 
* switch between cameras in a scene, a nice to have feature while experimenting with OpenGL.
